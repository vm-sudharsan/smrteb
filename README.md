An AI-powered utility billing web application that enables users to self-report electricity meter readings through smart automation.
Smart EB Bill Reader allows consumers to capture and upload a photo of their electricity meter using a React.js web interface, where AI-based OCR extracts the reading and validates it against the meter serial number and consumer ID. The system auto-generates bills by comparing current and previous readings stored in MongoDB and alerts EB officials only for missed submissions, minimizing unnecessary visits. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the solution enhances accuracy, reduces manual workload, and brings transparency and convenience to energy billing systems.
