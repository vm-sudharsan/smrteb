          <h2>SMART EB METER READER</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Smart EB Meter Reader</strong> is an advanced technology-driven solution designed to modernize electricity 
            meter reading, making it more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly. Traditional electricity bill calculations 
            and manual meter readings often lead to inaccuracies, delays, and human errors. Our system overcomes these challenges 
            by automating the entire process, ensuring accurate readings and real-time monitoring.
          </p>
        
          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Users can check their electricity consumption instantly through a digital interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Meter Readings:</strong> Eliminates manual efforts by providing automatic readings using IoT-based technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Accurate Billing System:</strong> Ensures precise calculations based on real-time usage, reducing billing discrepancies.</li>
            <li><strong>Seamless Digital Payments:</strong> Integrated with multiple payment gateways for instant and hassle-free transactions.</li>
